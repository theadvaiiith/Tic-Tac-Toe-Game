Description
This Python program is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game supports two players (Player X and Player O) with a graphical 3x3 grid. Player X has the first turn by default. Additionally, it implements features like an undo function and utilizes the Minimax algorithm for finding optimal moves, making it capable of providing an unbeatable AI opponent.

Key Features
Graphical Interface:

Buttons represent each cell on the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.

An undo button allows players to revert the last move.

Game Rules and Logic:

Players take turns marking empty cells with 'X' or 'O'.

The game ends when:

A player achieves three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

The grid is filled, resulting in a draw.

Artificial Intelligence (Minimax Algorithm):

AI player (X) uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move.

Depth is included in the scoring mechanism to prioritize winning sooner.

Reset Functionality:

The board resets automatically at the end of each game, ready for a new match.

Code Analysis
Strengths:
Clear and Modular:

The logic is divided into modular functions (evaluate, minimax, find_best_move), improving readability and reusability.

Optimal AI Decision-Making:

The Minimax algorithm ensures Player X (AI) always plays optimally.

Undo Feature:

Players can undo the last move, adding convenience and flexibility.

GUI Features:

Using Tkinter provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.

Opportunities for Improvement:
Scalability:

The game is limited to a 3x3 board; expanding this to allow larger boards would require significant modifications to the logic and interface.

Code Optimization:

The Minimax algorithm can become computationally expensive for larger boards. Adding techniques like Alpha-Beta Pruning would improve performance.

Styling and Customization:

Currently, the GUI is minimalistic. Adding visual flair (like animations or themes) could enhance the user experience.

Player Customization:

Allow players to choose between Player X and Player O for their turn and provide an option for two-player (non-AI) games.
